# metacritic
Metacritic.com is a review site for movies, videogames, music and tv shows. This project is focused on videogames and is divided into 4 sections:

### 1 - Data scraping
The first step is to get the data from metacritic website. Game information and reviews are scraped for each title of PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch platforms.

### 2 - Data cleaning
Once raw data is available cleaning tasks are done (e.g. dealing with missing values and incorrect formats). 

### 3 - Exploratory data analysis
A variety of analysis and visualizations are performed trying to answer different questions about the dataset in order to discover its main characteristics.

### 4 - Sentiment analysis
Several experiments are run to create a sentiment analysis classifier based on reviews. The objective is to train an algorithm that given a new review can classify it in positive or negative.
